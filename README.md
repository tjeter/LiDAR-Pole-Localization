# LiDAR-Pole-Localization
Project Description: LiDAR Path Following

Various autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, autonomous ground robots, and
drones, are already used in commercial and military services such as self-driving taxis,
terrain exploration, and contamination handling. Performing such complex tasks requires
a centimeter-level precision in estimating its own position with respect to the
surroundings. Previous work has demonstrated that EMI injections can manipulate the LiDAR-based
perception in autonomous systems: (Bhupathirajus et al.) (EMI-LiDAR: Uncovering
Vulnerabilities of LiDAR Sensors in Autonomous Driving Setting Using Electromagnetic
Interference). This project aims to characterize and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art path
following techniques under EMI injection attack.

Potential tasks:
=================
● Review LiDAR-based path following algorithms used in Autonomous Vehicles and
Robots.

● Use and classify APIs of existing simulation environment of LiDAR sensors.

● Develop a Python/C++/ROS-based implementation of path following algorithms.

● Characterizing the algorithm’s behavior with simulated EMI injection attacks.

Each member of a group was required to submit their own project report detailing their contribution.

Instructions to reproduce my Python-based implementation can be found in KITTI-Pole-Localization.txt
